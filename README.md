# PersonalityPredictionANN
Individual personality is a vital criterion in a human life as well as in a development of an organization. Every individual holds a different personality type which the differences in characteristic pattern in terms of thinking, feeling, and behaving. This research study the competencies of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in predicting the personality based on the Big Five personality model. The dataset to perform the ANN algorithm consist of 709 rows and 8 columns that being retrieved from open-source website called Kaggle is used for the training, validation, and testing process. The result will be produced in this study is the predicted personality like lively, dependable, responsible, serious, or extraverted when new data is inserted after the data training by ANN model. Although there are many algorithms like machine learning approach, findings proven that ANN algorithm is the best model with successfully achieve highest accuracy when compared with three different algorithms. The same dataset was used in this comparison. Further, the result of comparison, prediction, and analysis were presented and discussed.
